My first project. I'm trying to recreate the appearance of the google homepage using HTML and CSS.

What I learned:
Although the web page may look identical on my machine/browser, that does not mean it is the same on other setups. 

I should use consistent names for the 3 main div's, such as: 'header, content and footer' to improve readability for other people.
